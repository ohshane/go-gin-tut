Application Functionality

The application we'll build is a simple article manager. This application should:

1. Let users register with a username and a password (non-logged in users only)
2. Let users log in with a username and a password (non-logged in users only)
3. Let users log out (logged in users only)
4. Let users create new articles (logged in users only)
5. Display the list of all articles on the home page (for all users)
6. Display a single article on its own page (for all users)

* In addition to this functionality, the list of articles and a single article should be accessible in the HTML, JSON and XML formats.
